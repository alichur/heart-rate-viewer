## Future

An app where users can view their Fit-Bit heartrate data in more detail than available from the fitbit app.

* Add a Fit-Bit module to [Hello.js](https://github.com/MrSwitch/hello.js/tree/master/src/modules) to handle client side access to Fit-Bit's Oauth2 API.
* Retrieve data from [Fit-Bit's API](https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/heart-rate/).
* UI to allow drilling into heartrate data for a given time/data range.
* Support via a Flutter application.
